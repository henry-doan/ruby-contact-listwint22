# Basic Objectives

# Build a contact list

  # like the one on the phone 
# Create a menu that allows a user to select 1) Create a contact 2) View All Contacts 3) Exit
  # store all of our contacts 
  # datatype of what the contact is, what it has 
  # 1) Create a contact 
# inputs and outs of grabbing each value 
#  ex what is the new contact name 
#  ex what is the new contact phone number 
    # save the user input to a variable , need a variable for each attr
    # create a new contact with the variables in a object add to our collection
  # 2) View All Contacts 
    # go through the collection one by one 
    # display them in a reable way 
  # 3) Exit
    # say a good msg 
    # exit the program 
# The menu should loop until the user exits
  # loop 
  # recursion, calling a method within itself 

  # a way to store all contacts 
  @contacts = [
    # what does a contact have, attr?
